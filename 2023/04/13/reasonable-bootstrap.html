<p>Compilers for systems programming languages (C, C++, Rust, Zig) tend to be implemented in the languages themselves.
The idea being that the current version of the compiler is built using some previous version.
But how can you get a working compiler if you start out from nothing?</p>
<p>The traditional answer has been &ldquo;via bootstrap chain&rdquo;.
You start with the first version of the compiler implemented in assembly, use that to compile the latest version of the compiler it is capable of compiling, then repeat.
This historically worked OK because older versions of GCC were implemented in C (and C is easy to provide a compiler for) and, even today, GCC itself is very conservative in using language features.
I believe GCC 10.4 released in 2022 can be built with just a C++98 compiler.
So, if you start with a C compiler, it&rsquo;s not too many hops to get to the latest GCC.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t feel entirely satisfactory, as this approach requires artificially constraining the compiler itself to be very conservative.
Rust does the opposite of that.
Rust requires that rustc 1.x.0 is built by rustc 1.x-1.0, and there&rsquo;s a new rustc version every six weeks.
This seems like a very reasonable way to build compilers, <em>but</em> it also is incompatible with chain bootstrapping.
In the limit, one would need infinite time to compile modern rustc ex nihilo!</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> there&rsquo;s a better way if the goal is to compile the world from nothing.
To cut to the chase, the minimal bootstrap seed for Rust could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
source code for current version of the compiler
</li>
<li>
this source code compiled to core WebAssembly
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bootstrapping from this should be easy.
WebAssembly is a very small language, so a runtime for it can be built out of nothing.
Using this runtime, and rustc-compiled-to-wasm we can re-compile rustc itself.
Then, we can either cross-compile it to the architecture we need, if that architecture is supported by rustc.
If the architecture is <em>not</em> supported, we can implement a new backend for that arch in Rust, compile our modified compiler to wasm, and then cross-compile to the desired target.</p>
<p>More complete bootstrap seed would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Informal specification of the Rust language, to make sense of the source code.
</li>
<li>
Rust source code for the compiler, which also doubles as a formal specification of the language.
</li>
<li>
Informal specification of WebAssembly, to make sense of .wasm parts of the bootstrap seed.
</li>
<li>
.wasm code for the rust compiler, which triple-checks the Rust specification.
</li>
<li>
Rust implementation of a WebAssembly interpreter, which doubles as a formal spec for WebAssembly.
</li>
</ul>
<p>And this seed is provided for every version of a language.
This way, it is possible to bootstrap, in constant time, any version of Rust.</p>
<p>Specific properties we use for this setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Compilation is deterministic.
Compiling bootstrap sources with bootstrap .wasm blob should result in a byte-for-byte identical wasm blob.
</li>
<li>
WebAssembly is target-agnostic.
It describes abstract computation, which is completely independent from the host architecture.
</li>
<li>
WebAssembly is simple.
Implementing a WebAssembly interpreter is easy in whatever computation substrate you have.
</li>
<li>
Compiler is a cross compiler.
We don&rsquo;t want to bootstrap <em>just</em> the WebAssembly backend, we want to bootstrap everything.
This requires that the WebAssembly version of the compiler can generate the code for arbitrary architectures.
</li>
</ul>
<p>This setup does not prevent the trusting trust attack.
However, it is possible to rebuild the bootstrap seed using a different compiler.
Using that compiler to compiler rustc to .wasm will produce a different blob.
But using that .wasm to recompile rustc again should produce the blob from the seed (unless, of course, there&rsquo;s a trojan in the seed).</p>
<p>This setup does not minimize the size of opaque binary blobs in the seed.
The size of the .wasm would be substantial.
This setup, however, does minimize the total size of the seed.
In the traditional bootstrap, source code for rustc 1.0.0, rustc 1.1.0, rustc 1.2.0, etc would also have to be part of the seed.
For the suggested approach, you need only one version, at the cost of a bigger binary blob.</p>
<p>This idea is not new.
I <em>think</em> it was popularized by Pascal with p-code.
OCaml uses a similar strategy.
Finally, <a href="https://ziglang.org/news/goodbye-cpp/">Zig</a> makes an important observation that we no longer need to implement language-specific virtual machines, because WebAssembly is a good fit for the job.</p>
